# Air-quality-prediction-
The data set used as input for each of the prediction models were split as training and testing datasets at random locations to a percentage of 75% training data and 25% testing data so that the trained model can be run against the test data to compute how well the model performs and to avoid errors such as over-fitting. The prediction models which were trained using the training dataset were used to make predictions on the test data set where the absolute error for each reading was computed thereby obtaining the mean absolute
error and mean absolute percentage error to calculate the accuracy of the trained model. Model runtime, which is the time taken by the processor to execute the machine code and a measure of performance of the prediction model was calculated by running 10 iterations of training and testing cycles and obtaining the average for each prediction model.

Testing and validation carried out for the device provided with an overall accuracy of ~ 91%. The overall average accuracy of similar IoT systems range from 80%-85%. The developed air quality system shows an improvement in accuracy by approximately 6%-11% which shows that the calibration procedures followed during the study has had a positive impact.
